# Rap Libs Karaoke!

This is an Node CLI project that emulates the popular Mad Libs game with an early 90s hip-hop twist. 
 
## Install dependencies 
  
  First, install the node dependencies. 
 ```
 npm install 
 ```
 Then cd into the project folder and start the game. 
 ```
 cd rap-libs
 ```
 
 ```
 npm play
 ```
 
The user is then prompted and asked a series of questions in the CLI and after all of the questions have been answered we then use Text-to-speech technology to have the users computer speak back the NWA inspired mad lib freestyle.

It is a lot of fun! Give it a try!
